#Slash

> Slash is a minimal theme for Octopress.

This was cloned from [tommy351's project](https://github.com/tommy351/Octopress-Theme-Slash). I love the clean and beautiful theme.

## What I customized ##

- No twitter banner by default
- Changed font style for h1,h2,h3.. in article.
- No bold h1 in /archives pages.
- Optimized blockquote author and link footer margin and aligned right.
- Change `pre`, `code` font-size smaller in mobile devices.
- Img tag with 'no_fancybox' class will not be open as fancybox gallery.

##Install

Type the code below in terminal.

	$ cd octopress
	$ git clone git://github.com/kinopyo/Octopress-Theme-Slash.git .themes/slash
	$ rake install['slash']
	$ rake generate

Have problems when installing with zsh? Try `rake install\['slash'\]` instead.

##Features

- Read `alt` property of photos and add it below photos.
- Built-in [Fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) enables you to showcase your works easily.
- Resize HTML5 `video` and embedded video like `iframe`, `object` to page width automatically.
