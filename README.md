#Slash

> Slash is a minimal theme for Octopress.

This was cloned from [tommy351's project](https://github.com/tommy351/Octopress-Theme-Slash). I love the clean and beautiful theme.

## What I customized ##

- No twitter banner by default
- Changed font style for h1,h2,h3.. in article.
- No bold h1 in /archives pages.
- Optimized blockquote author and link footer margin and aligned right.

##Install

Type the code below in terminal.

	$ cd octopress
	$ git clone git://github.com/kinopypo/Octopress-Theme-Slash.git .themes/slash
	$ rake install['slash']
	$ rake generate

Have problems when installing with zsh? Try `rake install\['slash'\]` instead.
